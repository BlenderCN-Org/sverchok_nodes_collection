# sverchok_nodes_collection
Various nodes and blend files for the sverchok blender addon

* Polyvox experiments with sverchok addon. For now only a test you can find .blend, .json, and .py template to use with sv_ScriptedNode. Included PolyVoxCore.py and _PolyVoxCore.so for linux64.



#Todo

* more examples and other .json utilites, some little tutorials on basic mesh prototiping.
* extending the polyvox scripting nodes in order to have practical tools for voxelizing. (and maybe become part of the sverchok addon itself).
* Polyvox python bindings for windows.
* Upgrade the Polyvox bindings to the latest in dev.
