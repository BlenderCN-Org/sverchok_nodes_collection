In this reading we will enter with a metaphorical walk by the world of randomness
and noise.
We will start with elementary function and will go trough more complex concept
trough the powerful `Sverchok` nodes.
Randomness and noise are everywhere.We encounter these concepts during everyday life.
We try to make order against chaos but paradoxaly chaos is needed in many natural processes. Many scientists, engineers, visual rtists face up this aspect everyday.

But what is caos, what randomness?

In the next section i will explain it... with some nodes.
