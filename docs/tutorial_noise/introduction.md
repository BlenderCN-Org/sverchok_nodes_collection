### A brief parenthesis...

In this reading we will enter with a metaphorical walk by the world of randomness
and noise.
We will start with elementary function and will go trough more complex concept
trough the powerful `Sverchok` nodes.
Randomness and noise are everywhere. We encounter these concepts during everyday life.
We try to make order against chaos but paradoxaly chaos is needed in many natural processes. Many scientists, engineers, visual artists face up this aspect everyday.
As creative minds we can't miss to enter deeply into the worl of randomness and noise.

But what is chaos, what randomness?

In the next sections i will explain it... with some nodes.
